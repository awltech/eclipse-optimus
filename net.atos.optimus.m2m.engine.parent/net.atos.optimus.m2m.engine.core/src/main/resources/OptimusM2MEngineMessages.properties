TE01=[TE01] Starting Optimus.
TE02=[TE02] Optimus execution finished in {0} ms.
TE03=[TE03] Transformations discovery will be limited to following transformation sets: {0}
TE04=[TE04] Starting Transformations Execution...
TE05=[TE05] Transformations execution completed in {0} ms.
TE06=[TE06] Attempting to execute new Transformation {0} ({1}) on {2}.
TE07=[TE07] Attempt to execute transformation with id {0} refused. Ah ah ah ! You didn't say the magic word !
TE08=[TE08] Attempt to execute transformation with id {0} refused. Transformation Set has been evinced.
TE09=[TE09] Transformation with id {0} ({1}) for {2} has been already executed. Skipping.
TE10=[TE10] Transformation with id {0} has been disabled by user. Returning.
TE11=[TE11] Executing Required Transformations...
TE12=[TE12] Required Transformation with ID {0} was not executed. Returning.
TE13=[TE13] Transformation with ID {0} successfully executed on {1}.
TE14=[TE14] Requesting execution of pending transformation with ID {0} on {1}
TE15=[TE15] Starting Elements resolution from selected elements...
TE16=[TE16] Resolving selection from {0}
TE17=[TE17] Parent of Element added to selection: {0}
TE18=[TE18] Child of Element added to selection: {0}
TE19=[TE19] Request to schedule Transformation {0} for {1}
TE20=[TE20] Attempt to schedule transformation refused. Ah ah ah ! You didn't say the magic word !
TE21=[TE21] Transformation successfully scheduled.
TE22=[TE22] Requirement of Transformation with id {0} cannot be executed since it could not be resolved
TE23=[TE23] An exception was caught while executing transformation with ID {0} on {1}... Process is aborted... See Error Log for more details...
TE24=[TE24] Starting to compute subset of transformations, corresponding to transformationSet privacy & limitations.
TE25=[TE25] Computation of subset done successfully.
TE26=[TE26] Transformation with ID {0} is kept because its transformation set {1} is listed in the limited ones.
TE27=[TE27] Transformation with ID {0} is evinced, because its transformation set {1} is not part of the limited ones.
TE28=[TE28] Transformation with ID {0} is kept because its transformation set {1} is public.
TE29=[TE29] Transformation with ID {0} is evinced because its transformation set {1} is private.
TE30=[TE30] Executing transformations on objects part of the resolved elements...
TE31=[TE31] Executing transformations on objects part of the scheduled elements...
AD01=[AD01] Adapter {0} is now adapting {1}.
AD02=[AD02] Adapter {0} is not adapting {1} anymore.
AD03=[AD03] An Object is being modified while a transformation process is running. Throwing exception.
AD04=[AD04] {0} has been detected as child of input element. It is added as input element as well.
AD05=[AD05] Lock Adapter detected {1} addition into {0}. Will ensure child is also adapted with such Lock Adapter.
TS01=[TS01] Nature-Based Transformation Set implementation failed because of caught Exception: {0}
DC01=[DC01] Addition in default context overrides existing value ! (Source is {0} and key is {1}).
DC02=[DC02] Root addition in default context overrides existing value ! (Key is {0}).
DC03=[DC03] Property addition is default context overrides existing value ! (Key is {0}).
LG01=[LG01] Logger failed to use level from preferences. {0} seems to be an invalid value.
EP01=[EP01] Starting to load transformations referenced through Extension Points.
EP02=[EP02] Attempting to load TransformationSets from {0}.
EP03=[EP03] Creating Transformation set identified by {0}.
EP04=[EP04] Implementation of TransformationSet identified by {0} is a {1}.
EP05=[EP05] Is TransformationSet identified by {0} a public one ? {0}.
EP06=[EP06] Found contribution to TransformationSet identified by {0}.
EP07=[EP07] Creating Transformation identified by {0}, described by {1} ,with priority of {2}.
EP08=[EP08] Found already registered transformation identified by {0}, but with lower priority ({1} vs {2}). Dropping previous one.
EP09=[EP09] Found already registered transformation identified by {0}, but with higher priority ({1} vs {2}). Dropping this one.
EP10=[EP10] Creating self requirement from transformation identified {0} to transformation identified by {1}.
EP11=[EP11] Creating parent requirement from transformation identified {0} to transformation identified by {1}.
